# Express and MongoDB example project

To demonstrate the use of a 64-bit container, weâ€™ve developed a sample multi-container project that uses a few different technologies. The main idea is to plot a live chart containing the temperature and humidity of any city in the world. 

### What you will need:
- A download of the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/balena-io-playground/express-mongo-sample)
- Software to flash an SD card ([balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher))
- A free [balenaCloud](https://balena.io/cloud) account to setup and manage the Pi Download and install the [balena CLI tools](https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md) - to be installed on your computer, allowing you to install the project code on the Raspberry Pi 4.

You will also need to [set up environment variables](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/manage/serv-vars/#environment-and-service-variables) from the balena dashboard:

| Name             | Value  
| -----------------|------------------------------------                                   
| CITY_LATLNG     | The code corresponding to the latitude and longitude of the desired city comma separated. Ex: `38.722252,-9.139337`.
| API_KEY | [api key](https://darksky.net/dev) retrieved after signing up at `https://darksky.net`|
| FREQ | Frequency(in minutes) with which to retrieve weather data. |                                   
                    

> To get the Lat & Long for your city, you can use [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) and type the name of the desired city, such as Lisbon or London. On the `environment variable`, just combine both information comma separated such as  `38.722252,-9.139337`.

### About the project:

The project is divided into three containers:
* A mongoDB database instance with persistent storage, in which we will store all data. 
* A Python 3 application that fetches the weather information from the [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) API and saves it to the database every minute. 
* Node.js, ExpressJS, and VueJS application that fetches the data from the mongo database and displays it in a chart, which is refreshed automatically every minute.
